# Setting up the environment

Since ShmupCC scripts are written straight up as Classes instead of external script files, this means that they must be re-compiled every time a change has been made. The simplest way to manage all this is to download a Java IDE. Realistically, any Java-compatible IDE will work - VScode, IntelliJ, Eclipse. However, since I personally use Eclipse for development, any screenshots of code will be done in Eclipse.

Once you’ve downloaded your IDE, clone the ShmupCC github repository into your IDE. There are probably numerous tutorials on how to do this for whatever IDE you’re using so it won’t be covered here.

# Important
Make 100% sure that you’re compiling for JaveSE 1.8!!!
If you compile for any later versions, most people will not have a version of Java capable of running your game! This took me multiple days to figure out, so please save yourself from sharing my pain and just set the compile version to use 1.8!
