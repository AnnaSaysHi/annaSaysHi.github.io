# Timing
Understanding how timing works is essential to being able to do any sort of non-simple design. It is very difficult to understate the importance of knowing how to set up simple timing loops. For example, let's look at this code excerpt from my BHA8 submission and explain what's going on:

[code]@Override
public void [method=StageScript.tick,110]() {
	switch(chapter) {
	case 0:
		chapter1actions();
		break;
        ...
        //rest of the switch statement
    }
}

void chapter1actions() {
	if(stageTimer % 10 == 0) {
		boolean toMirror = (stageTimer % 20 == 0);
		double xSpawn = (parentGame.[method=Game.fetchRNG,110]()).nextDouble();
		xSpawn = xSpawn * 240;
		enmMgr.addEnemy(new Enm2(), xSpawn - 120, -32, 100, toMirror);
	}
	if(stageTimer == 60 * 12) {
		stageTimer = 0;
		chapter++;
		chapter2init();
	}
}[/code]

First off, [methodF=StageScript.tick,110] is a method that is called by the main class, `Game`, every frame. This method contains all the user defined stage logic. In our case, we use it as a branching point into one of several other methods based on what stage section we're on, which in my case is a variable I named `chapter`. Since we're in the first stage section, we call `chapter1actions()`, which I've separated from [method_notip=StageScript.tick,110] for readability and ease of testing.

Inside `chapter1actions`, we can immediately see a field called `stageTimer`. This field is auto-incremented before every call of [method_notip=StageScript.tick,110], which makes it very useful to measure time for a variety of things. Each enemy instance also has an equivalent of this field, fittingly called `enemyTimer`.

You can probably guess what the code above does: Every 10 frames, it spawns an enemy with a random X-position, and half of those enemies have a sort of "mirror" property. After 12 seconds have passed, the stage script will reset `StageTimer` and prepare for the start of the next stage section.

We've already touched on enemy spawning in the above section, so that's the next thing we'll cover...
Please wait warmly.
