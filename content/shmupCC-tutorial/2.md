# Making an empty stage
Now that you’ve set up everything you need to start scripting in this engine, let’s first learn how to make a new stage.

The first thing you’re going to want to do is to make a new class in the `game.stages` package. Let’s call our example class `Script_test`. Make sure that when you create `Script_test`, it extends `game.StageScript`, and check the “constructors from superclass” and “inherit abstract methods” boxes. Your new stage script should look like this:
[code]package game.stages;

import game.Game;
import game.StageScript;
import game.audio.SoundManager;
import game.bullet.BulletManager;
import game.enemy.EnemyManager;
import game.player.Player;

public class Script_test extends StageScript {
	public Script_test(BulletManager mgr, Game g, Player playerChar, EnemyManager enmMgr, SoundManager smgr) {
		super(mgr, g, playerChar, enmMgr, smgr);
	}

	@Override
	public void initActions() {
	}

	@Override
	public void tick() {

	}
}[/code]

At this point, if you were to load this script file, as expected, there would just be your player character, with no enemies to shoot and nothing to harm you. However, you wouldn’t be able to load this stage just yet, because there isn’t any way to select it in the scene select menu! To do this, we only need to edit a few lines of code.
One of them is in the main class, `Game.java`, which seems scary to edit, but you’re only editing the block that’s responsible for instantiating stage scripts to be executed. This block is currently located on lines 160 thru 165, and it looks something like this:

[code]stageList[0] = new Script1_1(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);
stageList[1] = new Script1_2(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);
stageList[2] = new Script1_3(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);
stageList[3] = new Script1_4(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);
stageList[4] = new Script_necropotence(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);
stageList[5] = new Script_BHA8(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);[/code]

If you want to add our brand-new script to the game, we’d need to copy-paste one of the lines but edit it to load our stage instead of a copy of one of the existing stages: [code]stageList[6] = new Script_test(BulletMGR, this, playerChar, EnemyMGR, SoundMGR);[/code]
We’d also need to increase the value of `SCRIPT_MAX` (located on line 19 in `Game.java`) or else we’ll get an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
